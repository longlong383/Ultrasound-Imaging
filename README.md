# Ultrasound-Imaging
This was a project done in BME 121 that collects ultrasound data from a program specified number of elements for each transducer, then based on the data, determine the magnitude/density from the intensity of the signal, input them into scanline which combined from multiple transducers and other scanlines, combines to make our ultrasound image.
